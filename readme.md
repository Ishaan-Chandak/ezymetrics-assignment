## Database Models

### Lead Model

The `Lead` model represents a lead in the application. It includes fields such as:

- `leadId`: Unique identifier for the lead.
- `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone`: Personal details of the lead.
- `status`: Current status of the lead (e.g., Interested, Qualified, Closed).
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when the lead was created.
- `source`: The source through which the lead was generated.
- `assignedTo`: Sales representative assigned to the lead.
- `company`: Company name associated with the lead.
- `leadScore`: Score indicating the quality of the lead.
- `salesRep`: The sales representative's name.
- `closedAt`: Timestamp when the lead was closed.

**Lead Schema Code:**

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const leadSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  leadId: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  firstName: { type: String, required: true },
  lastName: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, match: /.+\@.+\..+/ },
  phone: { type: String, required: true },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["Interested", "Contacted", "Qualified", "Closed", "Lost"],
    required: true,
  },
  createdAt: { type: Date, required: true, default: Date.now },
  source: { type: String, required: true },
  assignedTo: { type: String, required: true },
  company: { type: String, required: true },
  leadScore: { type: Number, required: true },
  salesRep: { type: String, required: true },
  closedAt: { type: Date },
});

const Lead = mongoose.model("Lead", leadSchema);
module.exports = Lead;
```

### Campaign Model

The `Campaign` model represents a marketing campaign and includes fields such as:

- `campaignId`: Unique identifier for the campaign.
- `name`: Name of the campaign.
- `type`: Type of campaign (e.g., Email, Social Media).
- `startDate`, `endDate`: Dates defining the campaign duration.
- `budget`: Budget allocated for the campaign.
- `leadsGenerated`: Number of leads generated by the campaign.
- `status`: Current status of the campaign (e.g., Ongoing, Completed).
- `createdBy`: User who created the campaign.
- `channel`: Channel used for the campaign.
- `performance`: Performance rating of the campaign.
- `conversionRate`: Rate of conversions from the campaign.

**Campaign Schema Code:**

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const campaignSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  campaignId: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  type: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["Email", "Social Media", "Event", "PPC"],
    required: true,
  },
  startDate: { type: Date, required: true },
  endDate: { type: Date, required: true },
  budget: { type: Number, required: true },
  leadsGenerated: { type: Number, required: true, default: 0 },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["Ongoing", "Completed", "Planned"],
    required: true,
  },
  createdBy: { type: String, required: true },
  channel: { type: String, required: true },
  performance: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["Excellent", "High", "Moderate", "N/A"],
    required: true,
  },
  conversionRate: { type: Number, required: true, default: 0.0 },
});

const Campaign = mongoose.model("Campaign", campaignSchema);
module.exports = Campaign;
```

## API Endpoints

### Fetch Leads

**GET** `/api/leads`

This endpoint retrieves all leads from the `leads.json` file and returns them as JSON.

**Example Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "leadId": "1",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    ...
  }
]
```

### Fetch Campaigns

**GET** `/api/campaigns`

This endpoint retrieves all campaigns from the `campaigns.json` file and returns them as JSON.

**Example Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "campaignId": "1",
    "name": "Summer Sale",
    "type": "Email",
    ...
  }
]
```

### Load Data to MongoDB

**GET** `/api/load-data`

This endpoint loads leads and campaigns from JSON files into the MongoDB database. It first clears the existing data and then inserts the new data.

**Example Response:**

```
Data loaded successfully
```

### Generate CSV Report

**GET** `/api/report/csv`

This endpoint generates a CSV report containing various metrics related to leads and campaigns. It calculates metrics such as lead conversion rate, lead-to-opportunity ratio, and churn rate, then sends the report as a CSV file.

**Example Response:**

```
Content-Type: text/csv
Attachment: report.csv
```
Screenshot of the csv report being sent:

And the PDF report can be found in the repository named as report.pdf


## Metrics Calculation

Metrics are calculated in the `metrics.js` file. The following metrics are implemented:

1. **Lead Conversion Rate**: Percentage of leads converted to closed status.
2. **Lead-to-Opportunity Ratio**: Ratio of qualified leads to total leads.
3. **Leads Assigned per Sales Rep**: Count of leads assigned to each sales representative.
4. **Lead Closure Time**: Time taken to close qualified leads.
5. **Pipeline Health**: Percentage of leads in the pipeline.
6. **Lead Acquisition Cost**: Cost to acquire a lead based on campaign budget.
7. **Top 5 High-Value Leads**: The top five leads based on lead score.
8. **Lead Churn Rate**: Percentage of leads marked as lost.
9. **Total Leads in Every Campaign**: Total leads generated across campaigns.

## PDF Generation

The `pdf.js` file contains functionality to generate PDF reports. The `generatePDFReport` function creates a PDF document with the report data.

**PDF Generation Code:**

```javascript
const PDFDocument = require("pdfkit");
const fs = require("fs");

const generatePDFReport = (reportData) => {
  const doc = new PDFDocument();
  const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("report.pdf");
  doc.pipe(writeStream);
  doc.fontSize(25).text("EzyMetrics Report", { align: "center" });
  doc.moveDown();

  reportData.forEach((item) => {
    doc.fontSize(12).text(`${item.Metric}: ${item.Value}`);
    doc.moveDown();
  });

  doc.end();

  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    writeStream.on("finish", () => {
      resolve();
    });
  });
};

module.exports = { generatePDFReport };
```

## Email Notification

The `email.js` file provides functionality for sending email notifications using Nodemailer. It uses an SMTP transporter to send emails to the specified recipient.

**Email Notification Code:**

```javascript
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.ethereal.email",
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: "your-email@example.com",
    pass: "your-email-password",
  },
});

const sendEmailNotification = async (recipient, subject, text) => {
  try {
    const info = await transporter.sendMail({
      from: '"Lead Notification" <your-email@example.com>',
      to: recipient,
      subject: subject,
      text: text,
    });

    console.log("Message sent: %s", info.messageId);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending email:", error);
    return false;
  }
};

module.exports = { sendEmailNotification };
```

Screenshot of Successful email notification being sent. Since I am using ethereal mail the mail does not actually gets sent but this can be used to make sure your api is working correctly and efficiently.
